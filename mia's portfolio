            I am a first-year architecture student at the New Jersey Institute of Technology. I am 17 years old and I am a recent gradruate from high school <br> 
            and Bergen Community College, thanks to a program at my school that allowed me to get an associates degree while being in high school. <br>
            Throuhgout my high school years, I took some art classes and I became very interested in architecture because of them. Also, my uncle was an <br>
            architect, and his work inspired me to some day do the same things that he did. In the future, I hope to become a licensed architect and work <br>
             in a field that challenges me creatively and makes me happy.
